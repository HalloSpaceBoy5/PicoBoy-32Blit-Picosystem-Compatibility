# PicoBoy-32Blit/Picosystem-Compatibility
This is a modified version of the 32Blit/Picosysten SDK that can run on a PicoBoy. Keep in mind that this software is still in beta, so it won't be entirely stable. The original source files are not mine, I did not create them. I have modified them to work on the PicoBoy. You can find the original files [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/picosystem/tree/main).

## What is this?
This is a modified version of the 32Blit/Picosystem SDK that can run on a PicoBoy. This means that the PicoBoy can run 32Blit/Picosystem games, opening up a huge library to the PicoBoy. 

## How can I install this on my PicoBoy?
You can install this on your PicoBoy by downloading the collection of .uf2 files from the releases section of this page. Afterwards, while holding the "BOOTSEL" button on the inside of your PicoBoy, plug it into your computer. A storage drive should mount. Drag any of the downloaded .uf2 files onto it and it should install automatically. Installing a Picosystem/32Blit game onto your PicoBoy will not delete your existing games, scores, and operating system.

## How can I revert back to PicoBoy OS?
You can revert back to PicoBoy OS by following these steps: Download the latest Micropython image from this [link](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/). While holding the "BOOTSEL" button on your PicoBoy, plug your PicoBoy into your computer. A storage drive should appear. Drag the file you just downloaded onto the drive. Once the drive unmounts, you should be back on PicoBoy OS.
